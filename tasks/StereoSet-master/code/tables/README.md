# Replicating Tables

This folder helps replicate the results shown in various tables. Due to the hidden test set, it may be impossible to obtain the exact same numbers for some tables, but you should get something in the neighborhood of what we report.

- `analysis.py` replicates the results for Table 1.
- `evaluation.py` in the parent folder replicates the results of Tables 4-6 and 7-8.
- `compute_domain_stats.py` shows the averaged results across multiple models.
- `find_universal_examples.py` finds examples that every model shared the same stereotypical bias for.
- `compute_terms_domains.py` replicates the results for Table 9.
