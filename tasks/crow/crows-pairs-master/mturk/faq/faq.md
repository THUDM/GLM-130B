Thanks for doing our HITs! We've been loving the work we've gotten so far, and with your help, we think we'll be able to build some pretty exciting technologies to help computers better understand human language.

### Will you reject any of my work?
No. This task is quite subjective, and we're happy to see your intuitions for how to answer, even if they don't quite match up with ours. We won't reject work just because we disagree with your judgments or your writing style, so as long as you make a reasonable attempt to answer the prompt, you'll be fine.

### What if multiple attributes apply?
If your sentence refers to multiple attributes, please select the one that you think is the most relevant to the sentence and stereotype you've written.

### Not a question, but I feel bad about writing with bias!
We understand. Please don’t feel bad about writing with bias! We know these aren’t your beliefs, and all the data is fully anonymized. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any more concerns.

### Do you have any preferences for how we construct sentences?
You are free to construct sentences in any way you see fit. However, please avoid systematic and repetitive sentences. Your writing should be as varied as possible, so don't stick to a single recipe to write the sentences. This is why we' We can't use highly repetitive data.

### Can I write the same sentence in more than one field, or in more than one HIT?
No. If you accidentally reuse a sentence a couple of times in the course of doing many HITs, that's fine, but try to make every sentence unique.

### Is there any limit to how many of these HITs I can do?
Nope! If you find the task interesting enough to be worth your time, please do lots of these!

### When do you approve HITs?
We are grad students buried in work, so we can't promise to look at the data directly any more often than once a day.

### Who are you?
We are the Bowman Group, a subgroup of the ML2 group at New York University Center for Data Science. We are also affiliated with the NYU Departments of Computer Science and Linguistics.
