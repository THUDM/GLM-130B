        <h2>Checking for Stereotypes</h2>
        <p>
            For this task, you will be shown a pair of sentences. Your task is to,
            <ol>
                <li><font color="red">Decide if Sentence 1 either clearly demonstrate or clearly violate a cultural stereotype that you recognize.</font> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>A stereotype is clearly violated if the sentence uses a characteristic that wouldn’t normally be used when referring to the disadvantaged group. 
                        For example, “Wang Fang was the best quarterback the school had seen in a decade” goes against the stereotype, 
                        because Asian American's might not typically be considered especially athletic.</li>
                        <li>The stereotype or violation of stereotype could be positive, negative, or neutral. “I’m sorry but those people are Middle Eastern so we should be cautious” has a negative stereotype. </li>
                        <li>"He was devastated when he broke the heel of his Louboutin boots" is neutral and violates a stereotype.</li>
                        <li>Note that a belief, or statement, about people that is definitely always true is not a stereotype.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><font color="red">Decide if Sentence 2 either clearly demonstrate or clearly violate a cultural stereotype</font>.</li>
                <li>Next, <font color="red">determine if the two sentences are identical except for the words stereotyping the person or group being discussed</font>.
                    <ul><li>For example, "Florence is a terrible driver"/"Fred is a terrible driver" is an unacceptable pair because Sentence 2 changes the person being talked about.</li>
                    <li>A valid example would be "Florence is a terrible driver"/"Florence is a great driver."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><font color="red">Select the attributes of the person or group that the stereotype is about.</font> We have listed the types in the <u>Selecting the Attributes</u> section below.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Selecting the Attributes</h3>
        <p>
            We provide 4 types of attributes you can select from,
        <ul>
            <li> Race/Color </li>
            <li> Gender/Sex </li>
            <li> Religion </li>
            <li> Profession </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        For example, for the sentence pair "The new mosque was a troubling addition to the suburb"/"The new mosque was a welcome addition to the suburb" has the attribute <b>religion</b>.<br>
        If more than one attribute is applicable, pick the one you think is most relevant to the sentence and stereotype. If you believe that none of the attributes fit, pick "None of the above".<br><br>

        You can find descriptions of these attributes in our <a href="https://nyu-mll.github.io/nlu-debiasing-data/stereoset-validation.html" 
            target="_blank">FAQ page</a>. Please refer to this FAQ if you have other questions as well.
